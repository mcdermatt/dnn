# Comp137 DNN: Assiginment 2 

In this assignment, you will implement a feedforward neural network and apply it to two learning problems: a regression problem and a classification problem. 

## Objective 

The objective of this assignment is further advance your understanding of Tensorflow. By implementing a dense layer and a feedforward model, you will get a sense 
how Keras build its learning models. 

You will also learn techniques of tuning learning models, which is one important technique for using deep neural networks.  

## Instructions 

Run the notebook `feedforward.ipynb` and follow instructions inside. 

To support the notebook, you will need to implement two classes and one function in `implementation.py`. After you finish all tasks correctly, you need to 
save the notebook as `feedforward.pdf`. 

## Grading

Detailed grading rules are inside the notebook. Finally, you need to submit 
* all files in this folder;
* two folders containing two trained models. 

To submit these files in a zip file, please zip all files in the folder `assignment2` into a zip file. All files/folders in `assignment` should be at the root of the zip file. Note please do NOT zip the assignment2 folder. If you use linux, you can run`zip -r assignment2.zip *` WITHIN the `assignment2` folder. 

Your implementations of the two classes and your trained models will be graded by the autograder through GradeScope.   

When we grade your code, we check your result notebook as well as your code. If your code cannot generate the result of a problem in your notebook file, you will get zero point for that problem. Actually, if you follow instructions in the notebook and finish all tasks, you are likely to get most points.
