%Generates impedance ellipses for human arm in random configurations
%throughout workspace

%TODO
%   Make this a function that can be called to generate lots of data
%   O P T I M I Z E
%   cartesian distance from hand to shoulder OR joint angles
%       Lets do the 7 joint angles

%Work flow for case of constant human
%1) set random initial joint angles
%2) perturb hand of human with unit force in 6 directions, measure 
%   displacement to obtain virtual impedance 
%3) Save data on
