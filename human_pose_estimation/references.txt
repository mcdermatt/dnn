Fitz Law
	Time to goal position is inversely proportional to size of bounded goal region
		(this is why buttons on websites are big)

Donder's Law
	Dondersâ€™s law assumes that the central nervous system uses a unique upper  arm orientation
	for each hand position in pointing tasks.

	Also states that the upper arm will return to this same position regardless of the direction in which it 
	traveled to reach such a position.

Minimum Work Model
	
	Does dragging around a ragdoll human arm violate the minimum-work model?
		Theoretically, dragging around an arm would by definition result in movement of the least work??
