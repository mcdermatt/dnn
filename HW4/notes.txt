Word Embeddings - ways to represent words in a NN
	
	one-hot
		(V,1) where V is the number of words in our vocabulary
	
	word2vec

	GloVe

activation function - Use Signoid or Tanh NOT RELU

Output function is Softmax

use Cross-Entropy loss func


Vanishing gradient problem
	
	network has trouble assigning value to words far away from current timestep

		standard RNN has single repeating layer


LSTM- Long Short Term Memory network

	h(t) = output value
	x(t) = input value

	More complex repeating layer with 4 parts		
		1) forget gate 
			ex: if we were talking about a male subject at the beginning of the sentence but are now referring to a female and need to switch the type of pronouns
		2) input gate & tanh vector of input canidate values
			ex: add the gender value of our new sentence subject
		3) update C(t-1) -> C(t) 
			multiply by sigmoid forget gate and add input/ tanh value
		4) filter and output
			sigmoid to decide what to output
			tanh to scale from -1 to 1
			multiply by output gate (so we only output what is desired)

GRU- Gated Recurrent Unit
	scary version of LSTM
