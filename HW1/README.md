# Comp137 DNN: Assiginment 1 

## Objective 
In this assignment, you will get familiar with `tensorflow` with a few simple functions. Then you need to implement a linear regression model with `tensorflow`. After this assignment, you will have a basic understanding of `tensorflow`. 

## Instructions 
All instructions of this assignment is in the notebook `a1notebook.ipynb`. To run the notebook, first activate the environment with `conda activate dnn`, then run the notebook  with the following command:

`$ ipython notebook notebook.ipynb`

and then follow instructions there. 

## Grading

There are 5 problems, each of which worths 4 points. Please finish all problems and save the notebook as `notebook.pdf`. 

Finally, you need to submit *all code files in this folder and the nodebook output in pdf*. When we grade your code, we check your result in the pdf
file as well as your code. If your code cannot generate the result of a problem in your pdf file, you will get zero point for that problem. Your code in `implementation.py` will be auto-graded through GradeScope.
